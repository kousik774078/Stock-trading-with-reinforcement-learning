# Stock Trading with Reinforcement Learning

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a reinforcement learning model for stock trading using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The aim is to create an environment where an agent can learn to trade stocks by interacting with historical stock data.

## Overview

The project involves the following key components:
- **StockTradingEnv**: A custom OpenAI Gym environment for stock trading.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Adding technical indicators like Moving Average, RSI, and MACD to the stock data.
- **Model Training**: Using the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines3 to train the model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, ROI, and Sharpe Ratio for performance evaluation.

## Files and Directories

- `mainppo.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for setting up the environment, training the model, and evaluating the results.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `eval/`: Directory to save evaluation metrics and trading results.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/One-to-1/stocktrading-with-reinforcement-learning.git
    cd stocktrading-with-reinforcement-learning
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `mainppo.ipynb` notebook and follow the steps to:
    - Load and preprocess stock data using `yfinance`.
    - Initialize the custom stock trading environment.
    - Train the PPO model.
    - Evaluate the trained model on test data.

2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the results and plots.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of profitable trades.
- **ROI**: Return on Investment.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measure of risk-adjusted return.

## Example Output

```sh
Model: ppo_IBM
Accuracy: 79.57%
ROI: -0.01%
Sharpe Ratio: 0.23
```
